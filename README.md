# 📅 AdvancedTC - Advanced Timesheet Calendar

A custom app for ERPNext that provides an advanced calendar view for managing timesheet details (Time Sheet Detail) with complete CRUD functionality, export and reporting capabilities.

## 🎯 Why AdvancedTC?

### Limitations of the Base ERPNext System

ERPNext, while being an excellent open-source ERP system, has some significant limitations in timesheet management that motivated the development of this custom app:

#### 🚫 **Standard System Issues**

1. **Limited Calendar View**: ERPNext provides a calendar view only for main Timesheets, but not for Timesheet Details, which can only be managed through tabular interface, making it difficult to visualize and edit individual activities temporally

2. **Unintuitive Interface**: Timesheet Detail management occurs through traditional forms, without drag & drop or visual editing

3. **Limited Filters**: The base system doesn't offer advanced filters for Employee, Project, Activity Type and Task in a single view

4. **Limited Export**: Lack of custom CSV export functionality with detailed statistics

5. **Complex Break Management**: Difficulty in managing breaks and lunch breaks within activities

6. **Missing Task-Employee-Project Validation**: ERPNext allows creating tasks for a project and assigning them to employees who are not associated with that project, causing confusion in management and access control issues

7. **No Weekly Timesheet Management**: The standard system does not automatically group activities into weekly timesheets, making reporting and data consistency more difficult

#### ✅ **Solutions Implemented in AdvancedTC**

- **Modern Calendar View**: Interface based on FullCalendar.js with intuitive temporal visualization
- **Drag & Drop**: Visual activity modification with dragging and resizing
- **Advanced Filters**: Integrated filter system in the sidebar for efficient navigation
- **Smart Export**: CSV export functionality
- **Advanced Break Management**: Native support for breaks with automatic creation of separate activities
- **Task-Employee-Project Validation**: Control system that prevents assignment of tasks to employees not associated with the project
- **Weekly Timesheet Management**: Automatic grouping of activities into weekly timesheets via dedicated backend and frontend logic
- **Complete Integration**: Maintains full compatibility with the existing ERPNext system

```

### Key Components

1. **hooks.py**: Configures app_name="advanced_tc", CSS, JS and workspace with automatic app screen integration
2. **install.py**: Installation script with workspace creation and informative messages
3. **advanced_tc.json**: Defines the main page configuration
4. **advanced_tc.js**: Frontend logic for interactive calendar
5. **timesheet_details.py**: Backend API endpoints for timesheet management
6. **timesheet_calendar.css/js**: Styling and utility functions for the calendar
7. **logo.svg/logo.png**: Application logos for the apps screen

## 🔐 Project Access Control

### Role-Based Project Visibility

AdvancedTC implements a sophisticated project access control system using ERPNext's native "Assign To" functionality:

#### **For Managers** (System Manager, HR Manager, HR User)
- **Full Access**: Can view and create activities for all open projects
- **No Restrictions**: Complete project visibility in filters and dialogs
- **Assignment Control**: Can assign projects to employees using ERPNext's "Assign To" feature

#### **For Employees**
- **Restricted Access**: Can only view projects assigned to them via "Assign To"
- **Automatic Filtering**: Project filters and activity creation dialogs show only assigned projects
- **No Assignment Access**: If no projects are assigned, they see an empty list with instructions to contact HR

### How to Assign Projects to Employees

1. **Navigate to Project**: Go to any Project document in ERPNext
2. **Use Assign To**: Click the "Assign To" button in the sidebar
3. **Select Employee**: Choose the employee(s) to assign to the project
4. **Automatic Access**: The employee will immediately see the project in AdvancedTC

### Security Features

- **No Fallback Access**: Employees without assignments cannot see any projects
- **Clear Messaging**: Users are informed when they need HR assistance for project assignment
- **Consistent Filtering**: Same access rules apply to sidebar filters and activity creation dialogs
- **ERPNext Integration**: Uses native ERPNext ToDo system for assignments

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Error "No module named 'advanced_tc'"

**Cause**: The app was not copied correctly to the `apps/` directory

**Solution**:
```bash
# Verify the app is in the correct directory
ls /path/to/frappe-bench/apps/advanced_tc

# If not there, copy the app
cp -r /path/to/advanced_tc /path/to/frappe-bench/apps/

# Verify essential files exist
ls /path/to/frappe-bench/apps/advanced_tc/advanced_tc/hooks.py
ls /path/to/frappe-bench/apps/advanced_tc/advanced_tc/__init__.py

# Just restart bench
# Sometime restarting bench resolve the issue
bench restart

# or stop and restart manually with Ctrl+C and then
bench start
```

### Error "InvalidGitRepositoryError"

**Cause**: The folder is not a valid Git repository

**Solution**:
```bash
# Option 1: Initialize as Git repository
cd /path/to/advanced_tc
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Option 2: Manual copy (simpler)
cp -r /path/to/advanced_tc /path/to/frappe-bench/apps/
cd /path/to/frappe-bench
bench --site [site-name] install-app advanced_tc
```

### Installation error

**Verify**:
1. **Python Version**: Make sure to use Python 3.10+
2. **Permissions**: Verify ERPNext base permissions on Timesheet doctypes
3. **Dependencies**: Check that ERPNext v15+ is installed
4. **Logs**: Check logs for specific errors

```bash
# Check logs
tail -f /path/to/frappe-bench/logs/web.log
tail -f /path/to/frappe-bench/logs/worker.log
```

### App is installed but not working

**Verify**:
1. **Migration**: Make sure migration is completed
2. **User permissions**: Verify user has necessary ERPNext base roles
3. **Cache**: Clear browser cache
4. **Restart**: Completely restart the bench

```bash
# Force migration
bench --site [site-name] migrate

# Clear cache
bench --site [site-name] clear-cache

# Restart everything
bench restart
```

    """Retrieve timesheet activities for the calendar"""
    
@frappe.whitelist()
def create_timesheet_detail(data):
    """Create a new timesheet activity"""
    
@frappe.whitelist()
